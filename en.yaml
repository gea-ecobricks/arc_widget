# Paragraph text for FAQ:  The Global Ecobrick Alliance is working with Arc to enable a revolutionary way for websites and webmasters to make the planet a better place.  By connecting our two breathrough technologies, anyone with a website can support both the decentralization of the internet and the removal of plastic from the biosphere.  Arc's peer-to-peer content delivery enables websites and their users to by-pass large centralized servers and speed up connections.  The GEA's manual authentication system allows the valuation and commodification of the removal of plastic from the biosphere by the decentralized global ecobrick movement.  By using Arc on a website, publishers can speed up the best of both worlds-- online and offline.
