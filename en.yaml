# Summary Paragraph text for website  FAQ:  Ecobricks.org and Arc enable a revolutionary opportunity for websites and webmasters to help make the planet a better place online for humans and offline for the oceans.  By connecting our two breakthrough technologies, anyone with a website can support both the decentralization of the internet and the removal of plastic from the biosphere.  Arc's peer-to-peer content delivery network enables websites and their users to by-pass centralized servers, speed up connectivity and transition on from invasive ad-driven revenue.  Meanwhile, Ecobricks.org and our AES plastic offsetting system connect directly to the decentralized global ecobrick movement.  Our underlying manual blockchain allows the valuation of preventing plastic from reaching the biosphere by rewarding ecobrickers doing the hard work.   By using Arc on a website, publishers can speed up the best of both worlds-- online and offline.
