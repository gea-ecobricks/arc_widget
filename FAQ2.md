 Arc.io and Ecobricks.org speeding up the internet and keeping plastic out of the biosphere.

Arc is a content delivery network that distributes data over a decentralized network of web page visitors.  Arc is a two-sided marketplace. On one side of the market, websites buy a fast, low-cost peer-to-peer CDN. On the other side, websites make money by contributing bandwidth to the peer-to-peer CDN. Arc's widget provides access to both sides.  Arc turns bandwidth into dollars by uniting browsers into a distributed content delivery network that we rent. Think screaming-fast BitTorrent for every website that's seamless and native to the web. Websites pay Arc to make their sites faster by serving their static content (images, videos, JS, CSS, etc) from Arc's global, distributed network of browsers instead of from slower, more expensive, centralized servers.

Ecobricks.org is an Earth Enterprise focused on securing plastic out of the biosphere and accelerating plastic transition.  On their GoBrik.com platform, almost a hundred thousands ecobrickers log their hard work sequestering plastic into Ecobricks.  This sequestration is authenticated on their manual blockchain through peer review.  Authenticated plastic can then be purchased on their offsetting system in kilograms.

Ecobricks.org and Arc enable a revolutionary opportunity for websites and webmasters to help make the planet a better place online for humans and offline for the oceans.  By connecting our two breakthrough technologies, anyone with a website can support both the decentralization of the internet and the removal of plastic from the biosphere.  Arc's peer-to-peer content delivery network enables websites and their users to by-pass centralized servers, speed up connectivity and transition on from invasive ad-driven revenue.  Meanwhile, Ecobricks.org and our AES plastic offsetting system connect directly to the decentralized global ecobrick movement.  Our underlying manual blockchain allows the valuation of preventing plastic from reaching the biosphere by rewarding ecobrickers doing the hard work.   By using Arc on a website, publishers can speed up the best of both worlds-- online and offline.

\# Paragraph on Arc for FAQ

\# By browsing a web page with the Arc + Ecobricks.org widget installed your extra bandwidth is used to help localize digital content for others viewing the same information.  Instead of connecting to content on a server on the other side of the planet, the content can be served by the computer nearest you!  This saves time and energy and is valuable service that websites pay for.  By directing the service payments of the CDN clients through the Ecobricks.org manual blockchain, dollars, kilobytes and kilograms of plastic can directly correlated.  Your visit to arc websites results in AES plastic offset credits purchased and the valuzation of the removal of plastic from the biosphere by ecobrickers around the world.
