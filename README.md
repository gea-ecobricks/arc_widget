<h1>Global Ecobrick Alliance Custom Arc Widget</h1>

The Global Ecobrick Alliance is working with Arc.io to combine technologies.  By merging their decentalized CDN with our Brikcoin blockchain, we'll be able to offer enterprises the ability to provide an ecological and internet service through their website.
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>1. To clearly and succintly explain how plastic is being offset by the using of the Arc CDN.</p>
 <p>2. To provide links to learn more about Arc and AES Plastic</p>
<p> 3. To inspire people to follow through and consider registering for Arc or GoBrik</p>
