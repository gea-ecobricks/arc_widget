<h1>Global Ecobrick Alliance </h1>

<2>Here's where we can directly edit the text that Arc's widget displays when it loads on our site-- and soon other sites</h2>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>1. To clearly and succintly explain how Arc is being used to directly support the removal of plastic from the biosphere.  
  2. To provide learning opportunities to those reading about our joint technolgoies of decentralized CDN and decentralized plastic sequestration for the first time.
  3. To inspire people to follo through to our Learn More page
4.  To keep our language as simple and accessible as possible.</p>
